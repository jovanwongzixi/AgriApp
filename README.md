# AgriVision

We are developing a suite of products (Agribox, Agricloud, Agriapp), under the Agrivision ecosystem, that taps on the opportunities presented in the crop research and commercial farming industry to benefit local and global food security.

## AgriBox
Firstly, we seek to achieve this through empowering researchers with more effective tools for crop research. Agribox, a smart grow box, provides researchers with control over crop growing conditions, enabling them to increase experimental efficacy.

## AgriCloud
Secondly, we believe the future of crop research lies in artificial intelligence, which is why we aspire to provide a go-to data repository for further advancements in Agritech. Agricloud, a cloud database, fosters global collaboration among researchers. By accumulating collected data from Agribox, Agricloud aims to benefit researchers worldwide and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.

## AgriApp
Lastly, Agrivision seeks to bridge the divide between the researcher and farmer communities. Agriapp, a one-stop platform developed to access the Agrivision ecosystem, holds farmer-researcher consultations to optimise farming yields. It also
allows researchers to remotely monitor and configure their Agribox environment.
